. Build the Docker Image:

1. Make sure you have Docker installed on both systems.
Create a Dockerfile in your project's root directory with the instructions mentioned previously.
Build the image:

Bash
docker build -t my-fastapi-app .
Use code with caution. Learn more

2. Push the Image to a Registry (Optional):

If you want to run the container on different systems without rebuilding it locally, push the image to a Docker registry like Docker Hub or private registries of your cloud provider:
Bash
docker login <registry> (e.g., docker login docker.io)
docker tag my-fastapi-app <registry>/my-fastapi-app
docker push <registry>/my-fastapi-app
Use code with caution. Learn more

 3. Run the Container:

On the target system, pull the image if you pushed it to a registry, or use the local image:

Bash
docker pull my-fastapi-app   # If using registry

# OR

docker run my-fastapi-app    # If using local image
Use code with caution. Learn more

This will start the container, running your FastAPI application. By default, it exposes port 8000, so your app will be accessible at http://localhost:8000.
